=== Problem: Nested expressions

How does the compiler check the Java code that you write and find
errors? Syntax checking and type checking are involved processes that
are key parts of compiler design. Compilers are some of the most complex
programs of any kind, and building one is beyond the scope of the
material covered in this book. However, we can get insight into some
problems faced by compiler designers by considering the problem of
correctly nested expressions.

There are many rules for forming correct Java code, but it is always the
case that grouping symbols (`(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`) are correctly
nested. Ignoring other symbols, we may find a section of code that
contains the sequence `"( ) [ ]"`, but correctly written code never
contains `"( [ ) ]"`.

To be correctly nested, left and right parentheses must be balanced,
left and right square brackets must be balanced, and left and right
curly braces must be balanced. Furthermore, a correctly balanced set of
parentheses can be nested inside of a correctly balanced set of square
brackets or curly braces (and vice versa), but they cannot intersect as
they do at the end of the previous paragraph. The table below shows more examples of correctly and incorrectly nested
expressions.

[.center%autowidth%header,cols="<l,<l",]
|===========================================
|Correctly Nested |Incorrectly Nested
|""|"("
|"(){}"|"}{"
|"((abc)){x}"|"( a { b ) c }"
|"({[z]})"|"{abc("
|"({xyz})({ijk}[123])"|"{(333)888(})"
|===========================================

But how can we examine an expression to see if it is correctly nested?
The key to solving this problem is the idea of a _stack_. A stack is a
simple data structure with three operations: _push_, _pop_, and _top_.
The data structure is meant to behave like a stack of books or cups or
any other physical objects. When you use the push operation, you are
moving something to the top of the stack. When you use the pop
operation, you are taking something off the top of the stack. The top
operation is used to read what is at the top of the stack. In a stack,
you can only read that very topmost item, as if all the other items were
buried underneath it. A stack is known as a FILO (first in, last out) or
a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure because, if you push a series
of items onto the stack and then pop them all off the stack, they come
off the stack in the reverse order from how they were added.

Armed with an understanding of the stack, it is straightforward to see
if an expression is nested correctly. Scan through each character in the
input and follow these steps.

1.  If it is a left parenthesis, left square bracket, or left curly
brace, put it on the stack.
2.  If it is a right parenthesis, right square bracket, or right curly
brace, check that the top of the stack is its matching left half. If it
is, pop the left half off the stack. If it isn't (or if the stack is
empty), the grouping symbols are either unbalanced or intersecting.
Print an error and quit.
3.  For any character that isn't a grouping symbol, ignore it and move
on.

If you reach the end of input without an error, check to see if the
stack is empty. If it is, then all of the left grouping symbols have
been matched up with right grouping symbols. If not, there are left
symbols left on the stack, and the expression isn't correctly nested.

=== Concepts: Object-oriented programming

To solve the nested expressions problem, we need to create a stack data
structure. Each element of the stack should be able to hold a `char`
value term from an expression, where a term is an operator, operand, or
a parenthesis (bracket or curly brace). Although we could get by using
only the static methods we introduced in the previous chapter, a better
tool can make programming easier.

We are introducing these topics in a progression: First, all of our
programs were a series of sequential instructions inside of a `main()`
method. We added in selection statements and loops to solve more
difficult problems. As our programs became more complicated, we started
using additional static methods to divide the program into logical
segments. Now, we are moving to fully object-oriented programming (OOP)
in which data as well as code can be packaged into objects that interact
with each other.

OOP has been a controversial topic, particularly in the computer science
education community. The most important thing to remember is that we are
not throwing away any of the ideas we used before. We are continuing on
a path toward making code safer and more reusable. Several other
chapters in this book touch on important ideas in OOP such as
inheritance and polymorphism. Below, we are going to focus on the
basics, including the fundamentals of objects, encapsulation of data,
and instance (non-static) methods.

==== Objects

You have already used objects, perhaps without realizing it. Every time
you use a `String`, you are using an object. So far, we have created a
class every time we have written a program. A class is a way to organize
static methods, but a class is something more: a template for objects.
Whenever you write a class, the potential to create specific objects
exists.

For a conceptual example, you can think of Human as a class and Albert
Einstein as an object (or an _instance_) of that class. The class
defines certain characteristics that all human beings have: name, date
of birth, height, and so on. Then, the object has specific values for
each one of those characteristics, such as Albert Einstein, March 14,
1879, 175, and so on.

.Example of a class serving as a template for an object.
image::class.svg[scaledwidth=100%,pdfwidth=100%,width=100%]

This idea of a class as a template is key because it means that an
object of a given type (from a given class) can be used anywhere that is
appropriate for another object of that type. Later in the chapter, we
create an object that performs the work of a stack, storing a number of
other objects. If we design a library of code that can manipulate or use
stack objects, we should be able to use this library countless times for
countless different stack objects without changing the code. This kind
of code reuse is one of the main goals of OOP.

==== Encapsulation

In order to guarantee that objects can be used in many different
contexts safely, the data inside of the object must be protected. Java
provides access modifiers so that code without appropriate permission
cannot change or even read the data inside of an object.

This feature is called _encapsulation_. One programmer may write the
class file defining a type of object while another or many others write
code that uses those objects. The programmers who use objects written by
others do not need to understand the inner workings of those objects.
Instead, they can treat each object as a "`black box`" with a list of
actions that the object can do. Each action has a certain specified
input and a certain specified output, but the internal functioning of
the object is hidden.

==== Instance methods

These "`actions`" are methods, but not static ones. Static methods did
not need an object in order to be called. Regular (instance) methods
should be thought of as an action performed on (or by) a specific
object. This action could be asking a question, such as inquiring what
the name of an object of type `Human` is. This action could be telling the
object to change itself, such as the case of pushing something onto a
stack.

One of the broadest definitions of an object is a collection of data and
methods to access that data. We call the data inside of an object its
_fields_ or instance data and the methods to access them _instance
methods_. Static methods are used primarily to modularize large blocks
of code into smaller functional units. However, instance methods are
tightly coupled to the fields of an object and perform tasks that change
the object or get information from it.

=== Syntax: Classes in Java

OOP concepts such as encapsulation may seem esoteric until you see them
in practice. Remember, we just want to create some private data and then
define a few carefully controlled ways that the data can be manipulated.
First, we'll describe how to declare fields, then explain how to write
instance methods to manipulate that data, and finally give more details
about protecting its privacy.

==== Fields

Fields in an object must be declared like any other data in Java. The
type of a piece of data can be a primitive or reference type. Fields are
also sometimes called member variables. You declare fields just like you
would class variables, except without the `static` keyword. Here's an
example with the `Human` class.

[source,java]
----
public class Human {
    private String name;
    private String DOB;
    private int height; //in cm
}
----

With this definition, a `Human` object has three attributes: `name`,
`DOB`, and `height`. Because the access modifier for each field is
`private`, code outside of this class cannot change or even read the
values. Note that this class cannot do anything yet. Also, note that
this class does not contain a `main()` method. There is no way to run
this class, but that's fine. We can add a `main()` method, of course.

[source,java]
----
public class Human {
    private String name;
    private String DOB;
    private int height; //in cm

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        name = "Albert Einstein";
        DOB = "March 14, 1879";
        height = 175;
    }
}
----

Now we have added a `main()` method, but our code does not compile.
Since the `main()` method is a static method, it is not associated with
any particular object. When we tell the `main()` method to change the
fields, it does not know what object we are talking about. If we
actually want to use an object, we'll have to create one.

.Class encapsulating the attributes of a human being.
[source, java, linenums]
[[HumanProgram]]
----
include::programs/Human.java[]
----

The above code compiles because we have used the `new` keyword to create
an object of type `Human` saved in a reference variable called
`einstein`. With a `Human` object, we can set its fields using
dot notation. With static methods and static variables, we used the name
of the *class* followed by a dot, for instance methods and instance
variables, we use the name of the *object* followed by a dot. Even
though each of these fields is private, we can access them from `main()`
because `main()` is inside the `Human` class. Code inside of another
class could create a new `Human` object, but it could not change its
fields.

This juxtaposition of static and non-static fields and methods inside of
a single class is confusing to many new Java programmers. The confusion
seems to stem from the fact that the class (such as `Human`) is a
template for objects but it is also a place to house other related code,
such as static methods, including `main()`.

Although the practice is discouraged, we mentioned in
<<Class variables>> that class variables can be
stored in the class itself. Every object has a distinct copy of each
field, but there is only a single copy of each class variable that they
all share. By using the keyword `static`, we could add a class variable
called `population` to our `Human` class, since that is information
connected to humans as a whole, not to any individual human being.

[source,java]
----
public class Human {
    private String name;
    private String DOB;
    private int height; //in cm
    private static double population = 7.023E9;
}
----

We are using a `double` to represent the world's population since the
value is too big to fit in an `int` and is easily expressed in
scientific notation. If several `Human` objects were created, they would
have their own `name`, `DOB`, and `height` values, but the value for
`population` would only be stored in the class.

.Class variables (static fields) are stored with the class, not with individual objects.
image::staticvalue.svg[scaledwidth=100%,pdfwidth=100%,width=100%]


==== Constructors

To create a new object, you have to invoke a _constructor_, a special
kind of method that can initialize the object. A constructor allows sets
up the values inside an object when it is first created. Let's consider
a simple `Rectangle` class with only two fields: `length` and `width`,
both of type `int`.

[source,java]
----
public class Rectangle {
    private int length;
    private int width;
----

One possible constructor for the class is given below.

[source,java]
----
    public Rectangle( int l, int w ) {
        length = l;
        width = w;
    }
----

This constructor lets us set the width and length when the object is
created. To do so, code could invoke the constructor using the `new`
keyword.

[source,java]
----
Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(50, 20);
----

This code creates a new `Rectangle` object, with length 50 and width 20.
Constructors are almost always `public`, otherwise it would be
impossible for code outside of the `Rectangle` class to create a
`Rectangle` object. Notice that the definition of the `Rectangle`
constructor does not have a return type. A constructors is the only kind
of method that does not have a return type. It is possible to have more
than one constructor as well, just as other methods can be overloaded.
For more information about overloaded methods, refer back to
<<Overloaded methods>>.

[source,java]
----
    public Rectangle( int value ) {
        length = value;
        width = value;
    }
----

In the very same class, we could have this second constructor, allowing
us to quickly and easily create a square. All classes have constructors,
but some are not written explicitly. If you don't type out a constructor
for a class, a default one is automatically created. The default
constructor takes no parameters and sets all the values inside the new
object to defaults such as `null` and `0`. Once you do create a
constructor, the default one is no longer provided. Thus, since our
definition of the `Rectangle` class already contains two constructors,
the following line would cause a compiler error if someone tries to use
it in their code.

[source,java]
----
Rectangle defaultRectangle = new Rectangle();
----

Another important thing to consider with all instance methods is scope.
Fields are visible inside of instance methods, but they can be hidden by
parameters.

[source,java]
----
    public Rectangle( int length, int width ) {
        length = length;
        width = width;
    }
----

This version of the two parameter `Rectangle` constructor compiles, but
it does not properly initialize the values of the fields `length` and
`width`. Instead, the parameters `length` and `width` are copied back
into themselves for no reason. The designers of Java anticipated that it
would be useful to refer to fields even in the presence of other
variables with the same name. To do so, the `this` keyword can be used.
Any field (or method) can be referred to by its object name, followed by
a dot, followed by the name of that field or method. Since you don't
have a variable name to reference the object when you're inside of it,
the `this` keyword acts as a reference to the object.

[source,java]
----
    public Rectangle( int length, int width ) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }
----

This version of the code functions correctly, since we have explicitly
told Java to store the argument `length` into the field `length` inside
the object pointed at by `this` and to do similarly for `width`.

==== Methods

Objects do not really come to life until you add instance methods. With
the `Rectangle` class described above, any `Rectangle` objects created
are not useful in other classes because it is impossible to access their
data. Instead, we want to create a clear and usable relationship between
the fields and the methods.

There are many different kinds of methods, but two of the most important
are accessors and mutators.

===== Accessors

We often want to read the data inside of various the objects. With our
current definition of `Rectangle`, no code from an outside class can
find out the length or width of the rectangle we are representing.

_Accessor methods_ (or simply _accessors_) are designed for this task.
By definition, an accessor allows us to read some data or get some
information out of an object without making any changes to its fields.
Accessors can be thought of as asking the object a question. The names
of accessors often start with the word `get`.

[source,java]
----
    public int getLength() {
        return length;
    }

    public int getWidth() {
        return width;
    }
----

Here are two accessors methods that we would expect in the `Rectangle`
class. The first returns the value of `length`, and the second returns
the value of `width`. These methods only report information. They do not
change the value of either variable. Their syntax should be
self-explanatory. Each is declared to be `public` so that anyone can
read the length and width of a rectangle. Both methods have a return
type of `int` because that is the type used to store `length` and
`width` inside a `Rectangle` object. Neither method has any parameters.
An accessor does not have to be so simple. An accessor could return a
value that needs to be computed from the underlying field data.

[source,java]
----
    public int getArea() {
        return length*width;
    }

    public int getPerimeter() {
        return 2*length + 2*width;
    }
----

These accessors compute the area and perimeter, respectively, of the
rectangle in question, even though that data is not stored directly in
the `Rectangle` object.

===== Mutators

Some objects, such as `String` values, are _immutable_ objects, meaning
that the data stored inside them cannot be changed after they have been
created with a constructor. If you have ever thought that you were
changing a `String`, you were actually creating a new `String` with the
appropriate modifications. Most objects are mutable, however, and we use
methods called _mutator methods_ (or simply _mutators_) to change their
fields.

Like accessors, mutators have no special syntax. The term is used to
describe any methods that change the data inside of an object. For the
`Rectangle` class, the only internal data we have is the `length` and
`width` variables. Mutators for these might look as follows.

[source,java]
----
    public void setLength( int length ) {
        this.length = length;
    }

    public void setWidth( int width ) {
        this.width = width;
    }
----

Just as the names for many accessors begin with `get`, the names for
many mutators begin with `set`. Mutators often have a `void` return type
because they are changing the object, not getting information back. Some
mutators might have a return type that gives information about an error
that occurred while trying to make a change. Note that we used the
`this` keyword once again to distinguish each field from the method
argument with the same name.

You may have noticed that we use the machinery of a method to both get
and set the `length` field, for example. Perhaps doing so seems
needlessly complex. After all, if the `length` variable had been
declared with the `public` modifier instead of the `private` modifier,
we could get and set its value directly, without using methods. In
response, let's improve the mutators that set `length` and `width`.

[source,java]
----
    public void setLength( int length ) {
        if( length > 0 )
            this.length = length;
    }

    public void setWidth( int width ) {
        if( width > 0 )
            this.width = width;
    }
----

With these better mutators, we can prevent a user from setting the
values of `length` and `width` to negative numbers or zero, values that
don't make sense for dimensions of a rectangle. For more complicated
objects, it becomes even more important to protect the values of the
fields from malicious or mistaken users.

[[subsection:Access_modifiers]]
==== Access modifiers

Hiding data is at the heart of the Java OOP model. There are four
different levels of access that can be applied to fields and methods,
whether static or not. They are `public`, `private`, `protected`, and
package-private.

`public` modifier::
The `public` access modifier states that a variable or method can be
accessed by any code, no matter what class contains it. Most methods
should be `public` so that they can be used freely to interact with
their object. Virtually no fields should be `public`. Constants (static
or otherwise) are the most significant exception to this rule. Making
constants `public` is usually not a problem since they cannot be changed
by outside code anyway. In the `Rectangle` class, variables `length` and
`width` are so simple that making them `public` is not unreasonable. If
you have a field that can be changed at any time by any code to any
value, you can leave that field `public`.
`private` modifier::
This modifier states that a variable or method cannot be accessed by any
code unless the code is contained in the same class. It is important to
realize that the restriction is based on the *class*, not on the
*object*. Code inside any `Rectangle` object can modify `private` values
inside of any other `Rectangle` object or class. Most fields should be
`private` so that outside code cannot modify them. Methods can be
`private`, but these methods should be helper or utility methods used
inside the class or object to divide up work.
`protected` modifier::
This modifier states that a variable or method cannot be accessed by any
code unless the code is contained in the same class, a subclass, or is
in the same package. This level of access is more restrictive than
`public` but less restrictive than `private` or default access. We
discuss it further in the context of subclasses and inheritance in
<<Inheritance>>.
Package-private (no explicit modifier)::
If you do not type an access modifier when you declare a field or
method, that field or method is not `public`. Instead, it has the
default or package-private access modifier applied to it. Fields or
methods with this modifier can be accessed by any code that is in the
same _package_ or directory. A package is yet another layer of
organization that Java provides to group classes together. When you use
an `import` statement, you can import an entire package of classes.
There is no keyword for this access modifier. It is useful if you are
designing a package containing classes that must be able to access each
other's fields or methods. For now, you should always give your fields
and methods an explicit `public` or `private` (or sometimes `protected`)
modifier.

From least restrictive to most restrictive, the modifiers are `public`,
`protected`, package-private, and `private`. Each additional level of
restriction removes a single category of access. All fields and methods
can be accessed by code from the same class. The following table gives
the contexts outside the class that can access a field or method marked
with each modifier.

[.center%autowidth%header,cols=">.>,3*^.>",]
|======================================================
|Modifier |Package |Subclass |Unrelated +
Classes
|`public` |Yes |Yes |Yes
|`protected` |Yes |Yes |No

=== Examples: Classes

Although large and complex programs are needed to see the real benefits
of OOP in Java, here are two short examples showing, respectively, how
objects can be used to make a roster of students and compute the value
of an expression in postfix notation.

.Student roster
====

We are going to create a `Student` class so that we can store objects
containing student roster information. Then, we're going to create a
client program that reads data from a user to create `Student` objects,
sort them by GPA, and then print them out.

[source, java, linenums]
----
include::programs/Student.java[lines=1..6]
----


We start by defining the `Student` class. First, there is a constant
array of type `String`, giving the names of each of the four years.
Next, the fields in the `Student` class store the name, year, and GPA of
the student.

[source, java, linenums]
----
include::programs/Student.java[lines=8..12]
----


We have one constructor for this class, which takes in a `String`, an
`int`, and a `double` corresponding to the name, year, and GPA of the
student. The constructor then internally uses mutator methods to store
the values into the fields. By doing so, we automatically take advantage
of the error checking in the GPA mutator.

[source, java, linenums]
----
include::programs/Student.java[lines=14..22]
----


These are the mutators corresponding to each of the three fields. The
input for the name and year mutators are not checked, but the GPA
mutator checks to make sure that the GPA value is in the proper range.

[source, java, linenums]
----
include::programs/Student.java[lines=24..32]
----


Finally, these accessors allow the user to find out the name, year, or
GPA of a given student. Every class in Java automatically has a
`toString()` method that is called whenever an object is being printed
out directly. We have changed this method to return the information in
`Student` formatted as a `String`.

Creating the `Student` class is only half the battle. We also must
create client code to use it.

[source, java, linenums]
----
include::programs/StudentRoster.java[lines=1..15]
----


The `main()` method in the `StudentRoster` class begins by reading in
the total number of students. Next, it makes an array of type `Student`
of that length. Then, it repeatedly reads in a name, year, and GPA,
creates a new `Student` object with those values, and stores it into the
array. After creating all the `Student` objects, it sorts them with a
method call and prints them out.

One oddity in this code is the seemingly superfluous `in.nextLine()` in
the first `for` loop. This line of code consumes a trailing newline
character from previous input. Take it out and see how quickly the
program malfunctions.

[source, java, linenums]
----
include::programs/StudentRoster.java[lines=17..28]
----


This `sort()` method is similar to others that you have seen. It
implements selection sort in ascending order based on GPA.

If you run this program, you will notice that it does not prompt the
user for any input. This version of the code is designed for redirected
input from a file. A more user friendly, interactive version should
prompt the user clearly.

Using OOP is not necessary to solve this problem. Instead of objects, we
could have used three separate arrays holding the name, year, and GPA of
each student, respectively. However, coordinating these arrays together
would become tedious, particularly when sorting.

====

=== Advanced: Nested classes

Inside of a class, you can define fields and methods, but what about
other classes? Yes! Doing so creates a _nested class_. When you define a
class inside of an outer class, it can access fields and methods in the
outer class, even if they are marked `private`. Java allows a number of
different ways to define a nested class. They are all useful, but each
is subtly different. Some nested classes are tied to a specific object
of the outer class while others are not.

==== Static nested classes

If you mark a nested class with the `static` keyword, you are creating a
class whose objects are independent of any particular outer class
object. Such a class is called a _static nested class_. Consider the
following class definition.

[source,java]
----
public class Outer {
    private int x;
    private int y;

    public static class Nested {
        private int z;
    }
}
----

A static nested class is similar to a normal, top-level class with two
differences. First, the full name of a nested class is the name of the
outer class followed by a dot followed by the nested class name. Second,
when given an outer class object, code in a static nested class can
access and modify `private` (and `protected)`) data in the outer class
object.

[.text-center]
.A static nested class object is allowed to access data from outer class objects even though there is no direct relationship between them.
image::nested.svg[scaledwidth=80%,pdfwidth=80%,width=80%]


Static nested classes can be used when the class you need is only useful
in connection with the outer class. Thus, nesting the class groups it
with its outer class. We can create an instance of the nested class
above as follows.

[source,java]
----
Outer.Nested nested = new Outer.Nested();
----

Because it is a static nested class, we do not need an instance of type
`Outer` to create an instance of type `Outer.Nested`. If you compile
`Outer.java`, it will create two files, `Outer.class` and
`Outer$Nested.class`. The dollar sign (`$`) separates the names of each
level of nested class in the file name. It is possible to nest classes
inside of nested classes, producing another `.class` file with another
dollar sign and the new class name appended.

Note that static nested classes can be marked `public`, `private`,
`protected`, or package-private (no explicit modifier). These access
modifiers control which code can access or instantiate static nested
classes using the sames access rules for fields and methods.

.Static nested class for testing
====

One application for static nested classes is testing. You can write code
that tests the functionality of your outer class, fiddling with its
fields if needed. Then, because a separate `.class` file is created, you
can deliver only the `.class` file for the outer class to your customer.

Consider the `Square` class, similar to the `Rectangle` class given
earlier.

[source,java]
----
public class Square {
    private int side;

    public Square( int side ) {
        this.side = side;
    }

    public int getArea() {
        return side*side;
    }
}
----

We could add a static nested class called `Test` to `Square` to test
that its `getArea()` and `getPerimeter()` methods are working properly.
The final code might be as follows.

[source,java]
----
public class Square {
    private int side;

    public Square( int side ) {
        this.side = side;
    }

    public int getArea() {
        return side*side;
    }

    public static class Test {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Square square = new Square(5);
            System.out.print("Test 1: ");
            if( square.getArea() == 25 )
                System.out.println("Passed");
            else
                System.out.println("Failed");

            square.side = 7;
            System.out.print("Test 2: ");
            if( square.getArea() == 49 )
                System.out.println("Passed");
            else
                System.out.println("Failed");
        }
    }
}
----

To run the tests, you would compile `Square.java` and then run the
nested class by invoking `java Square$Test`. It is unwise to use the
nested class to change the private fields in `square`, but we did so to
show that it is allowed by Java. A better test would create a second
`Square` object with a side of length 7.

====

==== Inner classes

Another kind of nested class is an _inner class_. Unlike static nested
classes, the objects of inner classes are associated with a particular
object of the outer class. You can think of an inner class object living
*inside* an outer class object. It is impossible to instantiate an inner
class object without having an outer class object first. Consider the
following class definition.

[source,java]
----
public class Outer {
    private int a;

    public class Inner {
        private int b;
        private int c;
    }
}
----

Every instance of `Inner` must be associated with an instance of
`Outer`. To instantiate an inner class, you use the name of an outer
class object, followed by a dot, followed by the `new` keyword, and then
the name of the inner class. We can create an instance of the inner
class above as follows.

[source,java]
----
Outer outer = new Outer();
Outer.Inner inner = outer.new Inner();
----

This syntax looks confusing, but it makes `inner` an object that exists
inside of `outer`. Thus, if there were methods defined in `Inner`, they
could refer to field `a`, because every instance of `Inner` would be
inside of an instance of `Outer` with a copy of `a`.

The relationship between outer and inner objects is one to many. We can
instantiate any number of inner class objects that all live inside of
the same outer class object.

[.text-center]
.An inner class object is always associated with a specific outer class object.
image::inner.svg[scaledwidth=80%,pdfwidth=80%,width=80%]


Another issue with inner classes (as opposed to static nested classes)
is that they cannot contain static fields (except for constants) or
methods. Since each instance of an inner class is tied to an instance of
an outer class, the designers of Java thought that static fields and
methods for an inner class really belong in the outer class.

It is even possible to define a class *inside* a method, if that class
is only referred to in the method. Such a class is called a _local
class_. It is possible to create an unnamed local class on the fly as
well. Such a class is called an _anonymous class_. Both local and
anonymous classes are special kinds of inner classes. Because of the way
they are created and used, we discuss them in <<Advanced: Local and anonymous classes>>

.Inner class objects as iterators
====

If you create a data structure for other programmers to use, a useful
feature is the ability to retrieve each item from the data structure in
order. Different threads or methods might need to process these elements
independently from each other. Each piece of code can be given an inner
class object called an _iterator_ that can repeatedly get the next item
in the data structure. Since instances of an inner class can read
private data of the outer class, iterators can keep track of where they
are inside the data structure. If outside code were allowed access to
the data structure's internals, it would violate encapsulation.
Iterators are a very common application of inner classes.

We can create a `SafeArray` class that only allows data to be written to
its internal array if it falls in the legal range of indexes.

[source,java]
----
public class SafeArray {
    private double[] data;

    public SafeArray( int size ) {
        data = new double[size];
    }

    public int set(int index, double value) {
        if( index >= 0 && index < data.length )
            data[index] = value;
    }
}
----

We could add an inner class called `Iterator` to `SafeArray` that allows
us to process all the array values without knowing how many there are.
This kind of behavior is useful for many dynamic data structures, as
discussed in <<Dynamic Data Structures>>.

[source,java]
----
public class SafeArray {
    private double[] data;

    public SafeArray( int size ) {
        data = new double[size];
    }

    public void set(int index, double value) {
        if( index >= 0 && index < data.length )
            data[index] = value;
    }

    public class Iterator {
        private int index = 0;

        public boolean hasNext() {
            return ( index < data.length );
        }

        public double getNext() {
            if( index >= 0 && index < data.length )
                return data[index++];
            else
                return Double.NaN;
        }
    }
}
----

The following method uses the iterator we have defined to find the sum
of the values in a `SafeArray` object.

[source,java]
----
public static findSum( SafeArray array ) {
    double sum = 0;
    SafeArray.Iterator iterator = array.new Iterator();

    while( iterator.hasNext() )
        sum += iterator.getNext();

    return sum;
}
----

=== Solution: Nested expressions

We now have enough knowledge to solve the nested expressions problem
from the beginning of the chapter. Classes help us divide up the work of
solving the problem. First, we need a stack class that can hold `char`
values.

.Simple stack class to hold symbols from an input expression.
[source, java, linenums]
[[SymbolStackProgram]]
----
include::programs/SymbolStack.java[]
----

The `SymbolStack` class allows us to perform the push, pop, and top
stack operations with methods of the same names. Its constructor takes a
maximize size for the stack and allocates an array of that size. It also
sets the `size` field to `0` so that we can keep track of how many
things are in the stack (and consequently where the top is).

The `push()` method stores an input `char` into the stack at location
`size` and then increments `size`. The `pop()` method simply decrements
`size`. It has no error checking to prevent a user from popping the
stack once it is already empty. Finally, the `top()` method returns the
value at the top of the stack, whose location is `size - 1`.
`SymbolStack` also defines an `isEmpty()` method so that we can see if
the stack is empty.

Now we need the client code that read the input and interacts with the
stack.

[source, java, linenums]
----
include::programs/NestedExpressions.java[lines=1..9]
----


The `main()` method of this class reads in the input and creates a
`SymbolStack` called `stack` with a maximum size of the input length. We
know that the stack never needs to hold more than the total input. It
also creates a `boolean` named `correct` to keep track of whether or not
the input is correctly nested. We start by assuming that it is.

[source, java, linenums]
----
include::programs/NestedExpressions.java[lines=10..37]
----


This `for` loop runs through each `char` in the input. If it is a left
parenthesis, left square bracket, or left curly brace, it pushes the
symbol onto the stack. If it is a right parenthesis, right square
bracket, or right curly brace, it checks to see if the stack is empty.
Because of short-circuit evaluation, the code does not even look at the
top of the stack if it is empty. However, if the stack is not empty, it
checks to see if the top matches the current symbol. If the stack is
empty or its top does not match, `correct` is set to `false`. For
efficiency, the loop stops early if `correct` is no longer `true`.

[source, java, linenums]
----
include::programs/NestedExpressions.java[lines=39..47]
----


After the input has been examined, we check to see if the stack is
empty. If it isn't, there must be some left symbols that were not
matched with right symbols. In that case, we set `correct` to `false`.
Finally, we print out whether the input is correctly or incorrectly
nested based on the value of `correct`.

=== Concurrency: Objects

Nearly everything in Java is an object: arrays, lists, `String` values,
colors, and even exceptions, which form Java's error-handling system and
is discussed in <<Exceptions>>. Some critics of Java
point out that `int`, `double`, and the other primitive types are not
objects, forcing the programmer to adopt two different programming
models. Regardless, threads are stored as objects as well. In
<<Concurrent Programming>>, we discuss how to create
threads and the various methods that can be used to interact with them.

However, objects of type `Thread` are not the only ones you deal with
when writing concurrent programs. As we have just noted, most data in
Java is encapsulated in an object. One of the deep reasons for using OOP
is safety: We want the private data inside of an object to stay in a
consistent state. Due to their inexplicable ability to get out of tight
situations, one tradition holds that cats have nine lives. Because of
their inquisitive nature, another tradition holds that curiosity killed
the cat. Consider the class below that keeps track of the lives a cat
has, losing one every time it becomes curious.

.Thread safety
====

.Records the number of lives a cat has left. Each `Cat` object starts with 9, but loses one each time it uses its curiosity. If no more lives remain, an error message is output.
[source, java, linenums]
[[CatProgram]]
----
include::programs/Cat.java[]
----

If the relationship between curiosity and mortality is the only feature
of a cat you are trying to model, this class appears to function well.
If the `useCuriosity()` method is invoked, it removes a life or prints
an error message if the cat has run out of lives. In a single-threaded
situation, this object would work perfectly. No cat would be able to
lose more than 9 lives.

In a multi-threaded situation, there is no telling when a thread might
pause in executing the `useCuriosity()` method. If 100 threads all
called `useCuriosity()`, each one might successfully pass the `if`
statement on line <<life_check>> before any had decremented `lives`.
Once past the check, nothing would prevent them from continuing on and
decrementing `lives`, resulting in a cat who lost 100 lives, resulting
in a total of -91 lives. Such a scenario makes no sense.

In <<Synchronization>>, we discuss how to prevent this
problem, using the `synchronized` keyword to allow only a single thread
at a time to execute the body of a method. The goal is to make
`useCuriosity()` _thread-safe_, meaning that its behavior is consistent
and correct no matter how many threads try to execute it at the same
time.

====

As you work through this book and begin to write your own concurrent
programs, we discuss ways to make them thread-safe. However, you are
also a consumer of code written by other people. In multi-threaded
environments, you may need to use library classes that are thread-safe.
For example, `AtomicInteger` is a thread-safe class designed to store
and manipulate `int` values. In <<Dynamic Data Structures>>, we talk about the `ArrayList` and `Vector` classes, which
are both used to hold variable length lists of objects. One of the few
differences between them is that `ArrayList` is not thread-safe while
`Vector` is. There is even the `Collections.synchronizedCollection()`
method (and other similar methods), which takes a collection that is not
thread-safe and returns a version of it that is.

Java was intended to be multi-threaded from the very beginning, but
concurrency was never the most important feature in the language. For
that reason, the documentation does not clearly mark which methods are
thread-safe. Usually, some of the paragraphs of description above the
list of methods say that a class is "`synchronized`" if it is
thread-safe. If it is not, the documentation may not mention anything.
Careful attention is needed to be sure which classes and APIs are
thread-safe.

You may wonder why all classes are not thread-safe, but everything comes
with a price. If a class is thread-safe, its methods are usually marked
with the `synchronized` keyword. The JVM is relatively efficient about
how it enforces that keyword, but the computational expense is not zero.
Learn the libraries well, and use the right tools for the right job.

2. [[exercise9.2]] What is the difference between a static method and an instance
method?
3. [[exercise9.3]] What is the purpose of a constructor? Why is it impossible for a
constructor to return a value? Why is it impossible for a constructor to
be called multiple times on the same object?
4. [[exercise9.4]] A static method can be called directly from a instance method, but
an instance method cannot be called directly from a static method. Why?
5. [[exercise9.5]] Describe the uses of accessor and mutator methods. Is it possible to
create a method that is both an accessor and a mutator? Why or why not?
6. [[exercise9.6]] Why do we usually mark fields with the `private` keyword when it
would be easier to make all fields `public`?
7.  [[exercise9.7]] What is the meaning of the `this` keyword? When is it necessary to
use it? When can it be ignored?
8. [[exercise9.8]] Consider the following class definitions.
+
[source,java]
----
public class A {
    private int a;

    public int get() {
        return a;
    }

    public static void increment() {
        a++;
    }
}

public class B {
    private int b;

    public B(int value) {
        b = value;
    }

    public A generate() {
        A object = new A();
        object.a = b;
    }
}
----
+
The field `a` is used three times in the previous code. Which of these
uses cause a compiler error and why?
9. [[exercise9.9]] In <<Solution: Nested expressions>>, we gave a definition of
`SymbolStack` that implements a simple stack using two fields, defined
as followed:

[source,java]
----
private char[] symbols;
private int size;
----
+
By calling the `top()` or `pop()` methods on an empty stack, it is
possible to cause a program to crash. What additional problems could
happen if `symbols` and `size` were declared `public` and malicious or
poorly written code had access to the object?

    public GroceryItem( String text, double money ) {
        String name = text;
        double price = money;
    }

    public String getName() { return name; }
    public String getPrice() { return price; }
}
----
+
This class compiles, but its constructor does not function properly. Why
not?
+
*Programming Practice*
11. [[exercise9.11]] OOP is often used when the data inside the object must maintain
special relationships. Consider a clock with hours, minutes, and
seconds. When the number of seconds reaches 60, the number of minutes is
increased by 1, and the number of seconds is reset to 0. When the number
of minutes reaches 60, the numer of hours is increased by 1, and the
number of seconds is reset to 0. When the number of hours reaches 13, it
is reset to 1. AM and PM switch whenever the number of hours reaches 12.
+
Define a `Clock` class with private `int` fields `hours`, `minutes`, and
`seconds` and a `boolean` field `PM`. Write a constructor that
initializes `hours` to `12`, `minutes` and `seconds` to `0`, and `PM` to
`false`. Write a mutator `increment()` that adds `1` to `seconds`. This
mutator should correctly handle all the clock behavior described above.
Write an accessor called `toString()` that returns a nicely formatted
version of the time as a `String`. For example, the initial time would
be returned as `"12:00:00 AM"`. Make sure you pad the output for
`seconds` and `minutes` with an extra `"0"` if they are less than `10`.
12. [[exercise9.12]] Draw on any of your hobbies to come up with a collection of items,
whether those items are books you like to read, athletes you follow,
music you collect, or anything else that is easy to classify. First
create a class that can describe one of these items with three to five
attributes. For example, the important attributes of a book might be
author, title, genre, and page count. Each of these attributes should be
stored as a `private` field and manipulated with `public` accessor and
mutator methods.
+
Using an array, create a database of these objects. Write methods that
print out all objects that have a particular value for an attribute.
Using the book example, your database program should let the user input
that he or she is looking for all books whose author is
`Alexandre Dumas`. You may wish to use input redirection so that you do
not have to enter data about your objects repetitively.
13. [[exercise9.13]] The `java.awt` package defines a class called `Point` that can be
used to manipulate an latexmath:[(x,y)] pair in programs involving the
Cartesian coordinate system. Create your own `Point` class with `int`
values `x` and `y` as fields.
+
Create one constructor that allows the user to specify values for `x`
and `y` and a default constructor that takes no arguments and sets both
`x` and `y` to `0`. Create accessors and mutators for `x` and `y`.
+
Finally, create a method with the signature
`public double distance( Point p )` that uses the distance formula
latexmath:[\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2+(y_1 - y_2)^2}] to find the distance
between the current `Point` object and the `Point` object `p` passed in
as an argument.
+
Write client code that allows you to create two `Point` objects and test
if the `distance()` method gives the right answer.
14. [[exercise9.14]] Re-implement the solution from <<Solution: Nested expressions>> so that it performs its input and output with GUIs created
using `JOptionPane`.
+
*Experiments*
15. [[exercise9.15]] Objects are great tools for solving problems, but there is some
additional overhead associated with creating objects and calling
methods.
+
Write a piece of code that allocates an array of 10,000,000 `int`
values. Iterate through that array, storing the value `i` into index
`i`, and time the process using an OS `time` command. As you know, the
`Integer` wrapper class allows us to store an `int` value in object
form. Repeat the experiment, but, instead of `int` values, allocate an
array to hold 10,000,000 `Integer` objects. Iterate through the array
again, storing an `Integer` object into each index of the array. For
index `i`, store a new `Integer` objected created by passing value `i`
into its constructor. Compare the time taken to the previous time for
`int` values. Do you think this is a reasonable way to estimate the time
it takes to call a constructor and allocate a new object?
