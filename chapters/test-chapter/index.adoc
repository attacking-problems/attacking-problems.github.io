=== Test of Regular Java Formatting

Here is an inline-specified ((program example)):

[source,java,linenums]
----
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Example { // <1>
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
        int value = in.nextInt(); // <2>
        System.out.print("That number doubled is: ");
        System.out.println(value * 2);
    }
}
----

<1> Beginning of class declaration.
<2> Get next integer from the input stream.

End of program text example.

=== Test of Outside File

Here is an imported-file ((program example)):

[source,java,linenums]
----
