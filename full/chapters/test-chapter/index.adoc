If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it.

=== Test of Regular Java Formatting

Here is an inline-specified ((program example)):

[source,java,linenums]
----
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Example { // <1>
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
        int value = in.nextInt(); // <2>
        System.out.print("That number doubled is: ");
        System.out.println(value * 2);
    }
}
----

<1> Beginning of class declaration.
<2> Get next integer from the input stream.

End of program text example.

****
Here is a sidebar.  It sits in an offset block, but doesn't float.

[discrete]
=== This Heading

That heading was marked as discrete, so it is formatted but not part of the overall
document structure.

=== Test of Outside File

Here is an imported-file ((program example)):

[source,java,linenums]
----
include::programs/GetInputCLI.java[]
----

<1> Create a Scanner object to read from the standard input stream.

A Java program to get the height, coefficient of
restitution, and number of bounces from the command line.

=== References

Various "items" (sections, figures, tables, sentences, etc.) can be labeled in
AsciiDoc.  The item can have a "custom ID" and "reference text".  A link using the
custom ID is replaced by the reference text.

[[reference-test, References Section Test]]
==== Section references

For example, this section ("Section references") has custom ID "reference-test" and reference text
"References Section Test". Here is a link: <<reference-test>>.

In most cases, though, it is enough to use the default reference text, which is the name
of the section.  For example, <<References>> (using complete name of section) and
<<fig-ref>> (using custom ID assigned where the section is defined).

[[fig-ref]]
==== Figure references

Another example is a figure.  By omitting the reference text, a figure link is
replaced by the figure number.  For example, <<image-test>>.

[[image-test]]
.This text is the image caption.

=== Equations and Formulas

We are using latexmath, not the Asciidoctor default math notation, AsciiMathML.

stem:[a + 3^3 + 5] is an inline formula.  This one is a display formula...

[stem]
++++
a + 3^3 + 5
++++
