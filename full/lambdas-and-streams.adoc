=== Problem: Cryptography tools

_Cryptography_, from Greek roots meaning "secret writing", is the science of
scrambling and unscrambling messages so that only the intended recipients can
read them. Forms of cryptography have been used since ancient times, often in
a military context. In fact, making and breaking codes played an important role
in World War II. Now, modern cryptography is an essential tool to protect
personal data as it's sent over the Internet. Without strong cryptography,
credit card data, social security numbers, and other private information would
be stolen by criminals even more than they are already.

The act of scrambling a message so that it's no longer readable is called
_encryption_. The act of unscrambling an encrypted message so that it's readable
again is called _decryption_. A normal, unencrypted message is often called a
_plaintext_. An encrypted message is called a _ciphertext_. Many encryption
algorithms use a _key_, an extra piece of information like a secret phrase, that
is needed when doing the encryption and decryption.

What's the right approach for designing a program that can encrypt and decrypt
data? It's tempting to pick your favorite encryption and build the program
around that. Unfortunately, cryptographers are always working to find ways to
defeat any given algorithm. Over the years, they might find weaknesses that
could allow attackers to unscramble a ciphertext, even without the secret key.
For that reason, a good framework for using cryptography should allow an
arbitrary algorithm to be used instead of forcing a user to keep using an
algorithm that has known security vulnerabilities.
