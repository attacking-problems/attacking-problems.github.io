=== Problem: Cryptography tools

_Cryptography_, from Greek roots meaning "`secret writing,`" is the science of
scrambling and unscrambling messages so that only the intended recipients can
read them. Forms of cryptography have been used since ancient times, often in
a military context. In fact, making and breaking codes played an important role
in World War II. Now, modern cryptography is an essential tool to protect
personal data as it's sent over the Internet. Without strong cryptography,
credit card data, social security numbers, and other private information would
be stolen by criminals even more than they are already.

The act of scrambling a message so that it's no longer readable is called
_encryption_. The act of unscrambling an encrypted message so that it's readable
again is called _decryption_. A normal, unencrypted message is often called a
_plaintext_. An encrypted message is called a _ciphertext_. Many encryption
algorithms use a _key_, an extra piece of information like a secret phrase,
that's needed when doing the encryption and decryption.

What's the right approach for designing a program that can encrypt and decrypt
data? It's tempting to pick your favorite encryption algorithm and build the
program around that. Unfortunately, cryptographers are always working to find
ways to defeat any given algorithm. Over the years, they might discover
weaknesses that could allow attackers to unscramble a ciphertext, even without
the secret key. For that reason, a good framework for using cryptography should
allow an arbitrary algorithm to be used instead of forcing a user to keep using
an algorithm that has known security vulnerabilities.

For that reason, we want to design a framework that can accept any (or at least 
a huge range of) encryption and decryption algorithms. We want the framework to
take care of iterating through all the characters in a message and send each
character off to the appropriate algorithm to be transformed from plaintext to
ciphertext or vice versa.

Most modern encryption algorithms like AES encrypt bytes (or blocks of bytes),
but our solution will use simpler algorithms that are designed to encrypt only
the capital letters A through Z from the Latin alphabet. The examples we'll use
are the Caesar cipher, the affine cipher, and the Vigenère cipher, all classical
substitution ciphers that have been used in the past but are now considered
unsecure. With a little additional work, it's possible to expand our solution to
secure algorithms as well.

==== Caesar cipher

Substitution ciphers are encryption systems that change each letter in a
plaintext to a different one. The Caesar cipher, used by Julius Caesar himself,
is perhaps the simplest possible substitution cipher. In it, the key is a number
1 through 25. This number says how many places later in the alphabet the
encrypted version of a letter is than the unencrypted version. For example, if
the key is 7, then each plaintext letter should be replaced with the letter that
comes seven steps later in the alphabet, wrapping around as needed. In this
case, the letter A is changed to H, the letter K is changed to R, and the letter
V wraps around the end of the alphabet to change into C.

The Caesar cipher is also called a shift cipher since we're shifting all the
letters of the alphabet over by a fixed amount.

Here's a table showing all the unencrypted alphabet with the
encrypted versions of each letter in each row below, when the key is 7.

[.center%autowidth%unbreakable,cols="<.^h,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^",]

|Ciphertext |U|V|W|X|Y|Z|A|B|C|D|E|F|G
|=======================================================================

Thus, the message `"CRY HAVOC AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR"` would be encrypted to
`"JYF OHCVJ HUK SLA ZSPW AOL KVNZ VM DHY"`. To decrypt a message, we move each
letter in the message back by the shift.


==== Affine cipher

The affine cipher takes the Caesar cipher a step further. Instead of simply
adding a value to each letter to encrypt it, we multiply each letter by a number
and then add a value to it. Thus, the key has two parts, a scalar _a_ and a
shift _b_.

In order to make the math simpler, we first convert the letters A through Z into
the numbers 0 through 25. That's the number that we multiply by _a_ before
adding _b_. Finally, we take the result modulus 26 so that any value larger than
25 maps back to the range 0 to 25. Written in mathematical notation, the
encrypted version of a letter whose value is _x_ is (_a_ · _x_ + _b_) mod 26.

Note that the scalar _a_ *must* be _coprime_ with the size of your alphabet, in
our case 26. Otherwise, different letters in the plaintext will map to the same
letters in the ciphertext, making it impossible to decrypt the original message.
Two numbers are coprime if they share none of the same prime factors. For an
alphabet with length 26, that means that _a_ can only have the values 1, 3, 5,
7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, or 25. When _a_ = 1, the affine cipher is simply
a Caesar cipher.

Here's a table showing all the unencrypted alphabet in the first row and the
encrypted versions of each letter in the second, with a value of 5 for _a_ and
8 for _b_.

[.center%autowidth%unbreakable,cols="<.^h,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^,^.^",]

|Ciphertext |V|A|F|K|P|U|Z|E|J|O|T|Y|D
|=======================================================================


With this cipher, the message `"CRY HAVOC AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR"` would
now be encrypted to `"SPY RIJAS IVX LCZ ULWF ZRC XAMU AH OIP"`. To decrypt a
message, we first subtract the value _b_ from each letter and then multiply by
the multiplicative inverse of _a_ modulus 26. Finding the multiplicative inverse
of a number can be done with brute force or some number theory, and we'll
discuss doing so in <<Solution: Cryptography tools>>.

==== Vigenère cipher

Both the Caesar cipher and the affine cipher are _monoalphabetic substitution
ciphers_, which is a fancy way of saying that a given letter in the plaintext
always maps to the same letter in the ciphertext. Although this property makes
encryption and decryption simple, it also makes both ciphers susceptible to
_frequency attacks_ in which the high frequency of letters like E in English can
be used to recover the plaintext from the ciphertext without knowing the key.

The Vigenère cipher is a _polyalphabetic substitution cipher_, meaning that
each letter can be replaced with several different letters, depending on where
in the message it occurs. Instead of using numbers, the Vigenère cipher uses a
special word or phrase as the key. The values of the letters in this phrase are
added to the values of the letters in the plaintext in order to find the
ciphertext.

For example, the letter N has value 13 (starting with A = 0). The letter S has 
value 18. 13 + 18 = 31. As before, we take the result modulus 26 to make the
number wrap around if it's too large. 31 mod 26 = 5. Since the letter F has the
value 5, adding the letter N from the plaintext to the letter S from the key
yields the letter F for the ciphertext. The table below shows the message
`"CRY HAVOC AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR"` encrypted with the Vigenère cipher,
using a key of `"SHAKESPEARE"`. Note that the key `"SHAKESPEARE"` is repeated as
many times as necessary to provide a letter to add to each letter in the
plaintext.

|=======================================================================

It turns out that repeating the key is what makes the Vigenère cipher vulnerable
to attacks. If the key is as long as the message (and is a totally random
sequence of letters), the Vigenère cipher becomes what's called a _one-time
pad_. It's impossible to attack a one-time pad without knowing the key, but it's
also very inconvenient to use a key as long as the message, particularly when
the message itself is long.

The Vigenère cipher dates back to the 16^th^ century and was believed to be
unbreakable for hundreds of years. However, methods that look at the frequency
of letters in sophisticated ways were developed in the 19^th^ century by
Friedrich Kasiski and separately by Charles Babbage, a pioneer of computing.

=== Concepts: Passing and storing methods

Creating a tool that can perform encryption and decryption with arbitrary
algorithms is useful, but that's just the beginning. Throughout this book, we've
created variables that could store *values*, and we could also pass those values
to methods. Now, we'll explore ways to store *methods* and pass those methods to
other methods.

This idea of methods as _first-class values_ is one that comes from a different
paradigm of programming. As we've discussed, Java is an object-oriented
programming language: All code is stored inside of a class. Programs can be seen
as a collection of objects interacting. Many variables are objects, though Java
breaks this rule with primitive types. These exceptions aside, a useful motto
for Java programming is "`Everything is an object.`"

On the other hand, in the _functional programming paradigm_, the motto is
"`Everything is a function.`" Languages that follow this paradigm, like Haskell,
Erlang, Clojure, and OCaml, focus heavily on methods, usually called functions
in these languages. When writing code in a functional language, it's typical to
write functions that take functions as parameters and return functions as
values. In fact, the purest functional languages have functions *instead* of
values. In some of these languages, zero can be thought of as a special
function. Then, the number 1 is conceived of as the function produced by
applying the successor function to zero. The number 2 is the function produced
by applying the successor function to the result of applying the successor
function to zero, and so on.

These languages also do not have (or at least discourage using) loops to perform
repetition. Instead, these languages rely heavily on _recursion_, using a method
to call itself, to achieve the same effect. Doing so is possible in Java, and
we discuss recursion more thoroughly in <<recursion#recursion>>. Functional
languages also disallow (or least discourage) changing the value of a variable
once it's been assigned.

If a language where everything's a function, there are no loops, and variables
can't be changed sounds bizarre to you, don't worry: People whose first
experience programming is with object-oriented or imperative languages are often
baffled when they come in contact with functional languages. On the other
hand, academic researchers into programming language design love functional
languages because they can be very elegant, have many wonderful safety
features, and follow mathematical structures that make it easier to prove
important properties about a program.

Although it's hard to make an objective measurement, many people consider
functional languages to be more difficult to program in than object-oriented
languages. Functional programming advocates will claim that, though it's harder
to get a functional program to compile in the first place, a programmer will
have more confidence that it works correctly when it finally does compile. While
functional languages aren't typically used by as many people as object-oriented
languages, there are certain niches like distributed systems where functional
languages provide valuable features. As always, use the right tool for the right
job.

And even if pure functional languages aren't overwhelmingly popular, they have
features that other languages liked enough to steal. Java 8 added lambda
expressions, method references, and functional interfaces: all tools to make it
easier to  use methods in a functional style. The language Scala runs on the
JVM, and it goes even further than Java in adopting functional approaches.

==== Method references and lambda expressions

In the previous paragraph, we used the word _lambda_, which is the letter λ from
the Greek alphabet. Because of a theoretical model of computing called the
_lambda calculus_ and the Lisp programming language that was influenced by it,
the word lambda has come to be associated with methods that are defined on the
fly, inside other methods, using the values of local variables when appropriate.

If you recall, we already did something similar in
<<Advanced: Local and anonymous classes>>. There, we created whole classes, both
local and anonymous, in the middle of a method, even incorporating the values of
local variables in one case. Lambda expressions do exactly the same thing,
except that the syntax is simpler, and we're only defining a single method
instead of a whole class.

A related concept is a _method reference_. In functional programming, we often
pass methods around as parameters. We can use lambda expressions to create a
method on the fly, or we can pass in the method of an existing object. You
should always pass in a method reference if the method you want already exists,
but creating a lambda is fine if one doesn't. On the other hand, if you're
writing many different lambda expressions that do essentially the same thing,
you might want to create a method so that you can pass a reference to it.

No doubt you're eager to learn the syntax for lambda expressions and method
references that we discuss in the next section, but when is it a good idea to
use these tools? A lambda expression is useful when all you require is a single
method, not a whole new class with member variables and perhaps many other
methods. These situations include:

- When you're using an interface that contains only one abstract method.
Lambda expressions can allow you to create a method that fulfills the
requirements of that interface. A great example is the `Runnable` interface that
we'll talk about in <<The `Runnable` interface>> when describing ways to create
threads.

- Event handling, especially in GUIs. As we'll discuss in <<gui#gui>>, a central
challenge of creating a GUI is defining what happens when a button is pressed or
some other event occurs. Lambda expressions make it easy to supply a short
segment of code that runs when an event happens.

- Working with collections. The Java Collections Framework (JCF) provides many
useful classes for storing data in lists, sets, and maps. To sort custom data
or retrieve only the objects that match certain criteria, the JCF provides
methods that you can supply a lambda to in order to say how data should be
sorted or which kinds of objects you want back.

- The Stream API. As we'll discuss in <<Advanced: Streams>>, the Stream API
expands the tools to create streams of data from collections that can be sorted,
filtered, aggregated, and processed in arbitrary ways using lambda expressions
that you supply.

Anywhere you can use a lambda expression, you can also use a method reference,
provided that the method you want already exists.

=== Syntax: Method references and lambda expressions

After all this discussion of the concept of passing methods around, no doubt
you're excited to do it yourself. Unfortunately, you can't.

As we said before, Java lives by the motto "`Everything is an object.`"
Consequently, we can pass objects around, not methods. But there's Java
construct that's primarily focused on methods, and that's the interface. As long
as we pass around objects that implement an interface with the method we want,
we can focus only on that particular method, ignoring other members and methods
that the object might have.

==== Functional interfaces

To make it absolutely clear when we want to focus only on one particular method
in an object, Java 8 introduced the idea of a _functional interface_. A
functional interface is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method.

Below is the functional interface `ArithmeticOperator`, which contains the
single method `evaluate()`.

[source, java]
[[Operator]]
----
include::{programsdir}/Operator.java[]
----

Note the text `@FunctionalInterface` that appears before the declaration of
`Operator`. The use of the `@` sign signals that
`@FunctionalInterface` is an _annotation_. While we will not discuss annotations
deeply in this book, the key idea behind them is that they provide extra
information that's usually not essential to the running of the program. In this
case, the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation gives the extra information to
someone reading the code that this interface is a functional interface, intended
to be used in situations where we want to pass around an object as if it were
only a single `evaluate()` method that takes two `int` values and returns a
third. The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation has no effect on the compilation or
running of the program except that an interface with this annotation will cause
a compiler error if it doesn't have exactly one abstract method.

The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation isn't necessary for functional-style
programming in Java. As long as an interface has exactly one abstract method,
you can use it as a type for storing or passing lambda expressions and method
references. However, it's always a good idea to mark an interface you write with
`@FunctionalInterface` if that's how you intend it to be used, both to inform
other programmers that it's a functional interface and to get the extra
protection from the compiler if you mistakenly add another abstract method to
it.

<<makeFunctionalInterfaceExercise>>

==== Method references

You can use method reference anywhere with a matching functional interface type.
In this case, we have the `Operator` functional interface that matches methods
that take two `int` values as parameters and return another `int` value.

Consider the following class that contains a simple method that finds the
maximum of two `int` values.

[source, java]
[[Max]]
----
include::{programsdir}/Max.java[]
----

Since the `max()` method inside the `Max` class takes two `int` values and
returns a third, we could store it into a variable with type `Operator`.

[source, java]
----
Operator operator = Max::max;
System.out.println(operator.evaluate(5, -3)); // Prints 5.
----

Note that we are using the `::` operator here, which lets Java know that we want
a reference to the `max()` method inside the `Max` class, instead of using `.`
as we would to call the method. In this case, we're supplying a reference to a
static method, but we can use the `::` operator to reference an instance method
as well.

Consider the following class that allows us to create `MaxWithMinimum` objects.
These objects have a `max()` method that finds the maximum of two `int` values,
but it also has a minimum value that it will give back as a default if neither
of the arguments are bigger than the minimum. A class like this might be useful
for situations where a value must always be above a certain threshold.

[source, java]
[[MaxWithMinimum]]
----
include::{programsdir}/MaxWithMinimum.java[]
----

As before, we can store the `max()` method into a variable of type `Operator`,
but now we have to put the name of the object, instead of the name of the class,
before the `::` operator.

[source, java]
----
MaxWithMinimum maxObject = new MaxWithMinimum(10);
Operator operator = maxObject::max;
System.out.println(operator.evaluate(5, -3)); // Prints 10, the minimum allowed.
----

This syntax parallels the way that static methods are called with a class name
while instance methods are called with an object name.

.Arithmetic expressions
====

We can use the `Operator` interface in a more extensive way to create nested
arithmetic expressions where the actual operation done (add, subtract, multiply,
or divide) is given by a method reference. First, we need to create an interface
for an expression. The only thing an expression needs to do is tell you its
value, so we put the `getValue()` abstract method in our `Expression` interface.

[source, java]
[[Expression]]
----
include::{programsdir}/Expression.java[]
----

We need two classes that implement `Expression`. The first is a simple class
designed to hold a single `int` value.

[source, java]
[[Number]]
----
include::{programsdir}/Number.java[]
----

The second class represents a calculation done on expressions (which can be
either simple numbers or expressions themselves).

[source, java]
[[Calculation]]
----
include::{programsdir}/Calculation.java[]
----
<.> The constructor for `Calculation` takes an operator and the two
subexpressions that the operator is being applied to.
<.> The `getValue()` method first gets the values of the two subexpressions and
combines those values using the `evaluate()` method of the operator.
<.> Static method to add two numbers.
<.> Static method to subtract two numbers.
<.> Static method to multiply two numbers.
<.> Static method to divide two numbers.


Although it took a lot of set-up, the final code that evaluates expressions is
relatively simple.

[source, java]
----
Expression expression1 = new Calculation(Calculation::add, new Number(3), new Number(5));
System.out.println(expression1.getValue()); // Prints 8.

Expression expression2 = new Calculation(Calculation::multiply, new Number(2), expression1);
System.out.println(expression2.getValue()); // Prints 16.

<<methodReferenceExercise>>

==== Lambda expressions

Like method references, lambda expressions can be used anywhere with a matching
functional interface; however, a lambda expression defines a method right where
you need it, without the requirement for an existing method in any class.

The syntax rules for lambda expressions are complicated, mostly because parts
of them can sometimes be left off to make code shorter and easier to read. Note
that lambda expressions always contain an arrow (`\->`) between the parameters
and the code that shows what computation the lambda does on the parameters.

A single-line lambda expression that adds two `int` values together, similar to
the `add()` method in the `Calculation` class, might look like the following. 

[source, java]
----
Operation add = (int a, int b) -> a + b;
----

In almost all cases, the types for the parameters in lambda expressions can be
omitted. The Java compiler uses a process called _type inference_ to determine
what the types should be. Thus, the code above could be written in a shorter
way.

[source, java]
----
Operation add = (a, b) -> a + b;
----

The parameters `a` and `b` still both have type `int`, but it's unnecessary to
state the type explicitly.

.Pitfall: Arrow symbols
[WARNING]
====
The arrow is not a single character you can type. Unicode contains several
characters with the appearance of an arrow, but like all Java operators, the
arrow used for lambda expressions is made up of characters that can be easily
typed on a standard keyboard. In fact, it's made up of two characters, a minus
(`-`) and a greater than (`>`). Although whitespace is generally unimportant in
Java, these two characters must appear next to each other to make an arrow, with
no space in between.

Some languages have an arrow that uses an equal (`=`) instead of a minus, making
an arrow whose appearance is `\=>`. This arrow is *not* a legal operator in Java
and cannot be substituted for `\->`.
====

In the two code segments above, we're storing a lambda expression into a
variable with a functional interface type, namely `Operation`. While doing so
is allowed, it's much more common to use a lambda expression directly, right
where we need it. For example, we can recreate the code from the end of the last
section using lambda expressions.

[source, java]
----
Expression expression1 = new Calculation((a, b) -> a + b, new Number(3), new Number(5));
System.out.println(expression1.getValue()); // Prints 8.

Expression expression2 = new Calculation((a, b) -> a * b, new Number(2), expression1);
System.out.println(expression2.getValue()); // Prints 16.
----

.Custom sorting
====
In <<The `Arrays` class>>, we introduced `Arrays`, a utility class that provides
tools for interacting with arrays. It contains several overloaded `sort()`
methods that can be used to sort arrays of data. While this approach works well
for sorting primitive data in ascending order, it will fail to sort reference
types unless they implement the `Comparable` interface.

However, we can use lambda expressions to sort reference types that don't
implement this interface. Better yet, we can also use lambda expressions to sort
objects based on any characteristic we're interested in. Consider the following
code.

[source, java]
----
String[] words = {"telephone", "architecture", "union", "drawers", "fruits"};
Arrays.sort(words);
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(words));
----

As expected, this code prints the words in dictionary order:
`[architecture, drawers, fruits, telephone, union]`

But what if we wanted to sort the words based on their length instead? We could
use the following code that includes a lambda expression to do the comparison.

[source, java]
----
Arrays.sort(words, (a, b) -> a.length() - b.length());
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(words));
----

Now, the words will be printed out from shortest to longest:
`[union, fruits, drawers, telephone, architecture]`

How does this sorting work? The lambda expression is clear enough: It takes two
parameters `a` and `b` (whose types it has inferred to be `String`) and
subtracts the length of `b` from the length of `a`. But _why_ does it work? The
key idea is that sorting requires the comparison of two objects. The sorting
algorithm will look at two objects and decide which one comes earlier in the
final sorted list. By making many comparisons between objects, it can ultimately
sort the whole list.

What adds another layer of complexity is that Java expects the result of a
comparison to be an `int` value. This value will be negative if the first object
comes earlier in the sorted order than the second, positive if the first
object comes later in the sorted order than the second, and zero if the two
objects go in exactly the same place in the sorted order (like two `String`
values with the same length). By subtracting the lengths of the two `String`
values, the lambda expression returns a negative number if the first `String`
has a length shorter than the second, a positive number if the first `String`
has a length longer than the second, and zero if the two `String` values have
the same length. Although unintuitive, this approach of subtraction can be
used for many kinds of comparisons.

Since most comparisons are based on characteristics of objects that can be
retrieved from methods, there are often ways to perform the comparison using
a method reference instead of a lambda expression. For example, we could have
achieved the same sorting by length as follows.

[source, java]
----
Arrays.sort(words, Comparator.comparingInt(String::length));
----

As before, the `sort()` method takes a custom `Comparator` object. In this case,
it's one created by doing an integer comparison (essentially subtraction) on the
result of applying the `length()` method from the `String` class to the
`String` objects in the `words` array. The exact mechanism of how the
`comparingInt()` method creates the right kind of `Comparator` object from the
`length()` method is murky and involves complicated type inference. However,
it's important to know that this technique is available since sorting objects
based on arbitrary characteristics comes up frequently in practice, and many
experienced developers believe that using a method reference is more readable
than a lambda expression.

There's one final caveat we want to mention about custom sorting. It is,
unfortunately, difficult to sort arrays of _primitive_ values using custom 
`Comparator` objects, because of the way that Java uses _generics_, a tool that
allows code to be written to work with many different types. We'll talk more
about generics in <<Generics in Java>>.

Sorting an array of `int` values in ascending order (smallest to largest), for
example, can be done with an overloaded version of the `Arrays.sort()` method.

[source, java]
----
int[] intValues = {34, 42, 90, 61, 29};
Arrays.sort(intValues);
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(intValues));
----

As you would expect, this code prints:
`[29, 34, 42, 61, 90]`

However, there's no straightforward way to sort these numbers in descending
order (largest to smallest). It would be tempting to use a lambda expression as
follows.

[source, java]
----
Arrays.sort(intValues, (a, b) -> b - a); // Does not compile!
----

However, only reference types (not primitive types like `int`) can be used
with the generic types that make the custom `Comparator` work, so this code
won't compile. For this specific case, there are two alternatives.

. Sort the list in ascending order and then write additional code to reverse it.
. Copy the contents of the array into an array of `Integer` values and use a
custom `Comparator` on that.

Simply by declaring the array as type `Integer[]`, we can sort it with a
custom `Comparator`.

[source, java]
----
Integer[] wrappedValues = {34, 42, 90, 61, 29};
Arrays.sort(wrappedValues, (a, b) -> b - a);
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(wrappedValues));
----

Because the comparison is based on `b - a` (rather than `a - b`), this code
sorts `wrappedValues` in descending order, giving: `[90, 61, 42, 34, 29]`

When using the `Arrays` class for sorting, remember that you'll only be able to
use a custom `Comparator`, based on either a lambda expression or method
references, if your array contains reference types. Sorting an array of
primitive types requires turning them into an array of the appropriate wrapper
class objects. Sometimes, this approach will be the best solution, but turning
primitive values into objects costs both time and extra memory.

===== Longer lambda expressions

Lambda expressions are perhaps at their best when they're shorter than a single
line. It both makes sense and is relatively readable to define a lambda
expression that only does one or two simple operations like addition or
subtraction. However, there are cases when a lambda expression must contain
several lines of code to get the job done, and Java provides a way to do this,
with slightly different syntax.

Recall the `Max` class in <<Method references>>. It contains a single method
called `max()` that finds the larger of two `int` values. We stored a reference
to this method in a variable with type `Operator` as follows.

[source, java]
----
Operator operator = Max::max;
----

Using the ternary operator, we could write a single line of code that finds the
larger of two values, but it feels more natural to write the code as we did in
the `max()` method. We can do so with a lambda expression by putting everything
after the arrow inside braces (`{ }`) and including appropriate return
statements.

[source, java]
----
Operator operator = (a, b) -> {
    if (a >= b) {
        return a;
    } else {
        return b;
    }
};
----

This code shows a longer lambda expression where everything after the arrow
looks like a normal method body. Note that a semicolon is still required after
the closing brace since the entire lambda expression is treated by the compiler
like a single expression, even though it takes up multiple lines.

What is perhaps even more surprising is that we can even include local variables
inside of a lambda expression. For example, the following code allows us to have
behavior similar to the `max()` method in the `MaxWithMinimum` class. It finds
the larger of two values but defaults to a minimum if neither value is as large
as the minimum.

[source, java]
----
int minimum = 10;
Operator operator = (a, b) -> {
    int result = minimum; // Use of local variable
    if (a >= result)
        result = a;
    if (b >= result)
        result = b;
    return result;     
};
----

.Pitfall: Effectively final
[WARNING]
====
When using local variables from an enclosing method inside of lambda expressions
(or anonymous inner classes), those local variables must be _effectively final_,
which means that their values are never changed once they've been assigned. You
can think of local variables as constants that are provided to a lambda
expression. It gets the value of the local variable and can use it for
computation, but Java requires that the value of that variable never changes.
The goal is to minimize confusion. What would it mean if a variable did change?
Could executing a lambda expression in later code change a local variable in a
way that isn't transparent to the programmer? Maybe the method containing that
local variable has already returned, so there is no local variable to update.
Likewise, what if the local variable had been changed before the lambda
expression was executed? Would it use the value it was created with or the
updated value?

The developers of Java decided to avoid all this complication by requiring the
variable to be effectively final. Another way to think about effectively final
variables is that they could be explicitly marked with the `final` keyword
without causing the compiler to complain about them being reassigned.

Consider the following code that is similar to the lambda expression above
except that it makes the largest value that it finds into the new minimum. Such
code might be useful if we wanted a series of maximum values that never decrease
over the course of the program.

[source, java]
----
int minimum = 10;
Operator operator = (a, b) -> {
    int result = minimum; // Use of local variable
    if (a >= result)
        result = a;
    if (b >= result)
        result = b;
    minimum = result; // Reassignment of local variable    
    return result;     
};
----

Because the local variable `minimum` is reassigned, it isn't effectively final,
and it *won't* compile.

Sometimes, this requirement forces the programmer to add an additional variable
to the body of a lambda expression, since that inner variable can be changed.
Note  that this requirement does not apply to member variables, which can also
be changed inside of lambda expressions.

==== Syntactic sugar

Java 8 was released in 2014, and people were excited to use the new functional
features it provided. As slick as these features are, they didn't make it
possible to do anything that was impossible before. Even though method
references were new, it had already been possible to make interfaces with a
single method and then store objects with a matching method into variables with
that interface type. While lambda expressions are much less clunky, the same
functionality could be achieved with anonymous inner classes.

Java 8 did make some fundamental changes to the JVM, but these changes mostly
had to do with memory management. By contrast, the functional programming tools
that we're discussing in this chapter are what some people call
_syntactic sugar_. Syntactic sugar refers to syntax that makes a language easier
to program without making deep changes to how the language works. The language
simply becomes sweeter to use.

To get a sense of the syntactic sugar that lambda expressions provide, let's
write code that defines a class that implements the `Operator` interface,
creating an `evaluate()` method that performs multiplication on its two inputs.
For the first version of the code, we'll use an anonymous inner class.

[source, java]
----
Operator multiply = new Operator() {
    @Override
    public int evaluate(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }            
};
----

This anonymous inner class approach works for pretty much every version of Java.
However, note how much syntax is needed to wrap up the only code that matters,
the code that specifies that `evaluate()` will multiply its two parameters.

From there, we can consider an equivalent version of the code that uses a lambda
expression but doesn't take advantage of all the shortcuts that could be used.

[source, java]
----
Operator multiply = (int a, int b) -> {
    return a * b;
};            
----

This code is functionally equivalent to the version using an anonymous inner
class. Internally, the JVM almost certainly creates a new object with an
`evaluate()` method that implements the `Operator` interface, but that tedious
work is taken care of for you.

Finally, we can consider the slimmest version of the code, which uses all the
syntax shortcuts that lambda expressions allow, sugaring the syntax even
further.

[source, java]
----
Operator multiply = (a, b) -> a * b;
----

As you've already seen in this chapter, we can usually leave off parameter types
in lambda expressions. For single-line expressions, we can also leave off the
braces and imply the return statement. Again, this code is functionally
equivalent to the first version using an anonymous inner class, but syntactic
sugar has allowed us to write it in a more concise, more readable way.

The enhanced `for` loops we discussed in <<Enhanced `for` loops>> are also
syntactic sugar since they allow a `for` loop to be written more compactly.
Examples of syntactic sugar exist in almost every language. There are tasks that
come up so frequently that the developers of the language decided to make a
shortcut for those tasks, even though existing syntax could get the job done.

It pays to be aware of syntactic sugar for two reasons. First, you'll
understand a language more deeply when you realize that one piece of syntax is
really just a shortcut for another. Second, programmers tend to prefer the
sugared version of syntax. Using the syntax that the community prefers allows
you to write more _idiomatically_, in the accepted style. Since programming is
about clear communication with both computers and other programmers, adhering
to a common style is valuable.

=== Advanced: Streams

When programming, we often have a list of data that we want to manipulate in
some way:

- Perform an operation with every value.
- Filter out certain values.
- Find a value that matches some criteria.
- Aggregate values to find information like the maximum, minimum, sum, or
average.

When you see these manipulations, you might immediately think of loops, likely
`for` loops. While loops are are a perfectly reasonable approach to manipulating
collections of data, Java 8 introduced an alternative, the Stream API, which
allows collections of data to be processed as _streams_.

Loops put the emphasis on iterating through data, with the operations done
specified in the body of the loop. Streams put the emphasis on the operations
being performed, with the assumption that these operations will be performed on
all the data (or at least all the data that matches the requirements). As with
the other functional tools, streams are a kind of syntactic sugar. You can't do
anything with streams that you couldn't do with loops, but many programmers find
streams easier to read and less prone to mistakes.

==== Creating streams

Streams are library code, not part of core Java. Most of the examples below will
assume that everything in the `java.util` and the `java.util.stream` packages
has been imported. To use streams, we first need to turn our list of data into a
stream. Consider the following code in which we start with an array of `String`
values.
 
[source, java]
----
String[] list = {"favorable", "acquit", "unfair", "insert", "vegetarian", "origin"};   
var words = Stream.of(list);
----

In this code, `words` will now contain a stream of `String` values. The
`Stream.of()` method can also take a comma-separated list of values with any
length. Thus, if you didn't already have an array you wanted to use, you could
put a list of values directly into a stream as follows.

[source, java]
----
var words = Stream.of("vegetarian", "acquit", "unfair", "insert", "favorable", "origin");
----

We'll discuss a number of other data structures in
<<dynamic-data-structures#dynamic-data-structures>>. Most of the standard Java
data structures in the Java Collections Framework (JCF) contain a `stream()`
method that puts the contents of the data structure into a new stream. Although
you might not yet be familiar with the `List` interface, it's a useful tool you
will use frequently as a Java programmer to store a list of data. The code below
shows an example with a `List` that results in a stream identical to the array
examples we've already given.

[source, java]
----
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("vegetarian");
list.add("acquit");
list.add("unfair");
list.add("insert");
list.add("favorable");
list.add("origin");   
var words = list.stream();
----

For now, it's not terribly important to focus on the syntax for creating a
stream. What is important is that Java provides a number of easy ways to
create streams from existing collections of data.

==== Terminal operations

Streams have a `forEach()` method that takes a method reference or lambda
expression saying what should be done with each element. Using `forEach()`
processes the stream, performing the operation on each element. The
`forEach()` method is a _terminal operation_, meaning that it's the last thing
that can be done to a stream. Once a terminal operation has been done, the
stream can't be used anymore.

The following code prints out every `String` in `words`.

[source, java]
----
words.forEach(e -> System.out.println(e));
----

The output for this code is below.

....
vegetarian
acquit
unfair
insert
favorable
origin
....

One can argue whether this stream-based approach to printing words is better
than using a loop directly. Regardless, it is readable and likely to take a
similar amount of time to execute.

There are many terminal operations in the `Stream` class that will, among
other things, determine if one or all elements in the stream match a condition,
collect the elements of a stream into another data structure, count the elements
in a stream, find an element in the stream that matches a condition, find a
maximum or minimum element, or reduce the elements in the stream to an
aggregate value like a sum.

==== Intermediate operations

Using only a terminal operation doesn't showcase the flexibility or power of
streams. Before performing a single terminal operation, programmers will often
apply one or more _intermediate operations_ on a stream. These operations
transform the stream by sorting it, removing values, or making a new stream by
processing the members of the original stream in some way.

The `filter()` method is a common intermediate operation that will keep only
the elements that meet a condition. In this case, the condition is given by a 
lambda expression or method reference that returns a `boolean`. For example,
we can first filter our stream by keeping only those `String` values whose
length is 8 or more and then print out whatever's remaining.

[source, java]
----
words
    .filter(e -> e.length() >= 8)
    .forEach(e -> System.out.println(e));
----

As you can see in the updated output below, we now only print out two words.

....
vegetarian
favorable
....

We can also apply multiple intermediate operations at once. For example, we can
sort the data after filtering it.

[source, java]
----
words
    .filter(e -> e.length() >= 8)
    .sorted()
    .forEach(e -> System.out.println(e));
----

As expected, we get the same two words but now in sorted order.

....
favorable
vegetarian
....

Note the indentation of the code above. When multiple operations are done on a
stream, many style guides encourage programmers to indent each operation on a
separate line, in order to improve readability.

Intermediate operations can do more than remove or reorder elements from the
stream. The `map()` method creates a new stream by applying a function to
elements from the original stream. For example, the following code will
transform the stream of words into a stream containing each word concatenated
with itself, before printing out this new stream.

[source, java]
----
words
    .map(e -> e + e)
    .forEach(e -> System.out.println(e));
----

The output is each word doubled.

....
vegetarianvegetarian
acquitacquit

==== Streams of primitive values

In <<Advanced: Generic data structures>>, we'll discuss generic types, a way
to program data structures with a type variable, allowing, for example, a list
class to be designed to hold a specific (but unknown) type that a user can later
specify inside angle brackets (`< >`). For example, `ArrayList<String>` is a
type for a list of `String` objects, but `ArrayList<Wombat>` is a type for a
list of `Wombat` objects. Generic types allow a library designer to program a
list class a single time that will work with any specific type, combining code
reuse with type safety.

Generic types were introduced in Java 5, after the language had made many
significant design choices. Unfortunately, some of these design choices meant
that primitive types could never be supplied for a generic type variable. Thus,
`ArrayList<Integer>` is allowed, but `ArrayList<int>` is not. Because the Java 8
Stream API builds heavily on generic types, they had to make specialized streams
to accommodate primitive types.

Specifically, you may want (or need) to use `IntStream`, `LongStream`, or
`DoubleStream` if you need streams of `int`, `long`, or `double` values. No
specialized streams are available for `boolean`, `byte`, `char`, or `short`.


Instead of using the `Stream` type to create primitive streams, use the
specific primitive stream type.

[source, java]
----
var numbers = IntStream.of(3, 4, 5, 6, 7);
----

These streams can be created from existing lists or generated with the
`iterate()` method (and additionally with the `range()` and `rangeClosed()`
methods for `IntStream` and `LongStream`. The following code generates five
identical streams.

[source, java]
----
int[] array = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
var stream1 = IntStream.of(array);                       // <.>
var stream2 = IntStream.of(3, 4, 5, 6, 7);               // <.>
var stream3 = IntStream.range(3, 8);                     // <.>
var stream4 = IntStream.rangeClosed(3, 7);               // <.>
var stream5 = IntStream.iterate(3, e -> e + 1).limit(5); // <.>
----
<.> Creates `stream1` from an existing array.
<.> Creates `stream2` from an explicit list of `int` values.
<.> Generates `stream3` from the range of values from 3 up to (but not
including) 8.
<.> Generates `stream4` from the range of values from 3 up to (and including) 7.
<.> Generates `stream5`, starting at 3 and incrementing the value by 1 each
time, limiting the length of the stream to 5 elements.

These streams of primitive values behave exactly like general streams, but they
can be more efficient and add a few useful methods like `max()`, `min()`, and
`sum()`, which find the maximum value, the minimum value, and the sum of all
the elements in the stream, respectively. Note that these methods are terminal
operations and so can only be called once per stream. Also, `max()` and `min()`
return a special optional type that requires a `getAsInt()` (or similar), since
the result could be `null` if the stream is empty.

[source, java]
----
System.out.println(stream1.max().getAsInt()); // Prints 7.
System.out.println(stream2.min().getAsInt()); // Prints 3.
System.out.println(stream3.sum());            // Prints 25.
----

<<timingStreamAgainstLoopExercise>>

==== Lazy evaluation

In the example above where we create an `IntStream` with the `iterate()` method,
we give the starting point of 3 followed by a lambda expression to add 1 to the
current value in order to get the next value. Without the `limit()` method, we
would have defined an infinite stream, which is allowed.

In fact, infinite streams aren't necessarily a problem since all streams use
_lazy evaluation_. Laziness is generally considered negative, but it can be an
admirable quality in computer science. Lazy evaluation means that a stream
doesn't do computation on an element in the stream until it's needed. Adding a
long sequence of intermediate operations doesn't mean that those operations will
get performed on everything in stream. For example, the `findFirst()` and
`findAny()` methods are terminal operations that will return only a single
element from the stream. When using `findFirst()`, it will transform the first
element of the stream based on intermediate operations, and if the first element
matches, it will return that element, without processing others in the stream.

Because of lazy evaluation, no work on an element in a stream is triggered until
a terminal operation requires that element. This design means that programmers
don't need to worry too much about efficiency when planning the order of
intermediate operations. Consider the following code that generates 100
elements, waits 1,000 milliseconds (one second) for each one, limits the size of
the stream to 5 elements, and then prints out each remaining element.

[source, java]
----
IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 100)
    .peek(e -> {
        try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException ex) {}            
    })
    .limit(5)
    .forEach(e -> System.out.println(e));
----

The `peek()` method is an intermediate operation that allows the programmer to
use each element of the stream before the terminal operation, "`peeking`" at its
value. In this case, we're only using the `peek()` method to call the
`Thread.sleep()` method to wait for a second, ignoring the value of the element.
A quick reading of this code segment might suggest that the program would wait a
total of 100 seconds. Instead, it only waits 5, since only the elements that are
processed by the terminal operation are processed by `peek()`. Because the
`limit()` step comes after the `peek()` step that does the waiting, it seems
like all 100 elements should incur a wait of one second, but the order of
intermediate operations doesn't matter in this case.

Lazy evaluation means that programmers can focus on what the intermediate
operations should be, instead of their order. The biggest performance gains from
lazy evaluation happen when the stream processing stops after finding a single
element or when processing only a fraction of the total elements in the stream.
Lazy evaluation won't give any speed improvement when every element in a
stream is processed, but it won't cause any problems, either.

If a programmer is concerned about squeezing every ounce of performance out of a
repetitive task, loops will provide more control. Thus, loops could be a better
solution when performance really matters. However, lazy evaluation makes streams
competitive with loops, without requiring much analysis about the most efficient
way to process intermediate operations.

=== Solution: Cryptography tools

Now, we can solve our original problem of making a reusable framework for
several different encryption schemes. The first step is to make a functional
interface for a method that takes a `char` (the letter to be encrypted) and an
`int` (the index of that letter in the message) and returns a new `char` (the
encrypted version).

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/Processable.java[]
----

With the `Processable` functional interface in place, we can develop classes
to perform encryption and decryption with methods that match this interface.
First, we'll make a class for the Caesar cipher.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/CaesarCipher.java[]
----
<.> The constructor takes an `int` value specifying the key for the Caesar
cipher, the number of places to move a given letter of the alphabet forward. If
the key is negative, it repeatedly adds 26. Then, it takes the result modulo 26,
eliminating keys larger than 25. The final key is guaranteed to be between 0 and
25.
<.> The `encrypt()` method matches the `Processable` interface and encrypts a
single letter using the Caesar cipher. First, it subtracts `'A'` so that the
value is from 0 to 25. Then, it adds the key value. Next, it takes the result
modulo 26 so that values larger than 25 will wrap back around to remain in the 0
to 25 range. Finally, it casts the result to a `char` since doing arithmetic on
`char` values results in an `int` value.
<.> The `decrypt()` method also matches the `Processable` interface but decrypts
a single letter using the Caesar cipher. It follows the same process as
`encrypt()` except that it subtracts the key value and adds 26 (in case
subtracting the key value makes a negative number, which would be a problem
since the modulo operator in Java doesn't work correctly with negative values).

We can also add a class for the affine cipher.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/AffineCipher.java[]
----
<.> The constructor takes two `int` values specifying the key for the affine
cipher. The key is made up of two values, _a_ and _b_, where a given letter
whose numerical value is _x_ will be encrypted to _a_ · _x_ + _b_.
<.> To work, a value for _a_ must have a multiplicative inverse modulo 26. In
other words, there must be some number _a_^-1^ such that _a_ · _a_^-1^ mod 26 = 1.
We use a `while` loop to run through the only legal values for an inverse, 1
through 25. If we don't find an inverse, we throw an exception.
<.> The `encrypt()` method matches the `Processable` interface and encrypts a
single letter using the affine cipher. Like the Caesar cipher, it subtracts
`'A'` so that the value is from 0 to 25. Then, it multiples by _a_ and adds _b_.
Again, like the Caesar cipher, it takes the result modulo 26 so that values
larger than 25 will wrap back around to remain in the 0 to 25 range. Finally, it
also casts the result to a `char`.
<.> The `decrypt()` method also matches the `Processable` interface but decrypts
a single letter using the affine cipher. It follows a similar process as
`encrypt()` except that it subtracts _b_ and multiplies by _a_^-1^.

Although it's possible to add even more ciphers, the last one we'll add is the
Vigenère cipher.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/VigenereCipher.java[]
----
<.> The constructor takes a `String` value specifying the key phrase for the
Vigenère cipher. It loops through the characters in the key to be sure they're
all uppercase letters.
<.> The `encrypt()` method matches the `Processable` interface and encrypts a
single letter using the Vigenère cipher. Unlike the previous two ciphers, the
Vigenère cipher uses the index value so that it knows where in the ciphertext it
is (and consequently which character in the key it should use). It uses the
index modulo the length of the key so that locations in the original message
that are longer than the key will wrap back around to legal locations in the
key. To make the values of the letters be between from 0 to 25, it subtracts 
`'A'` from both. Then, it adds the two values together and takes the result
modulo 26 so that values larger than 25 will wrap back around to remain in the 0
to 25 range. Like the previous two ciphers, it casts the result to a `char`.
<.> The `decrypt()` method also matches the `Processable` interface but decrypts
a single letter using the Vigenère cipher. It follows a similar process as
`encrypt()` except that it subtracts the key letter instead of adding it.

With the `Processable` functional interface and some sample encryption schemes
to use, we're finally ready to make our framework for encryption and decryption.
In fact, it won't use very much code.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/CryptographyFramework.java[lines=1..15]
----
<.> The critical method we need is `process()`, which takes an input `String`
and a method reference or lambda expression (in the form of a `Processable`
interface) and returns the processed output. By writing our code carefully, we
can use this method for both encryption and decryption.
<.> Because `process()` might be encrypting or decrypting a long `String`, it
uses a `StringBuilder` which is more efficient than doing repeated `String`
concatenations. We first introduced `StringBuilder` in
<<efficientConcatenationExample>> from <<repetition#repetition>>.
<.> Many encryption algorithms can encrypt any sequence of bytes, but this code
assumes classical encryption algorithms that can only encrypt uppercase
letters. As a defensive coding measure, it converts the input to an uppercase
version.
<.> The code loops over the length of the input `String`.
<.> Only uppercase letters (rather than a symbols or whitespace) are processed.
<.> Here the `process()` method from the `Processable` object is used to perform
the actual encryption or decryption. This method can be supplied as a method
reference or a lambda expression.
<.> If `letter` is not an uppercase letter, it is appended to `result`
unchanged. Doing so is a bad idea from the perspective of strong encryption, but
it will make it easier to test our program. 
<.> Finally, `result` is converted into a `String` and returned.

Although the `process()` method is the only one required for our framework,
it's useful to have a `main()` method we can use to test the system.

[source, java]
----
include::{programsdir}/CryptographyFramework.java[lines=17..40]
----
<.> For testing purposes, we'll encrypt
`"CRY HAVOC AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR"` from _Julius Caesar_ by William
Shakespeare.
<.> This `caesarCipher` object implements the Caesar cipher with a key of 7.
<.> This `affineCipher` object implements the affine cipher with a key whose _a_
value is 5 and _b_ value is 8.
<.> This `vigenereCipher` object implements the Vigenère cipher with a key of
`"SHAKESPEARE"`.
<.> The first ciphertext is encrypted by calling `process()` with a reference to
the `encrypt()` method of the `caesarCipher` object.
<.> The first ciphertext is decrypted to the original message by calling
`process()` with a reference to the `decrypt()` method of the `caesarCipher`
object.
<.> The second ciphertext is encrypted by calling `process()` with a reference
to the `encrypt()` method of the `affineCipher` object.
<.> The second ciphertext is decrypted to the original message by calling
`process()` with a reference to the `decrypt()` method of the `affineCipher`
object.
<.> The third ciphertext is encrypted by calling `process()` with a reference to
the `encrypt()` method of the `vigenereCipher` object.
<.> The third ciphertext is decrypted to the original message by calling
`process()` with a reference to the `decrypt()` method of the `vigenereCipher`
object.

The output of running this program is as follows.

....
Caesar Cipher (key = 7)
Ciphertext: JYF OHCVJ HUK SLA ZSPW AOL KVNZ VM DHY
Plaintext:  CRY HAVOC AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR

Affine Cipher (key = 5x + 8)
Ciphertext: SPY RIJAS IVX LCZ ULWF ZRC XAMU AH OIP
Plaintext:  CRY HAVOC AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR

Vigenere Cipher (key = SHAKESPEARE)
Ciphertext: UYY LSKSC EFK VIL WLZT AHO VDKS SX WKV
Plaintext:  CRY HAVOC AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR
....

Of course, we could add more and more encryption schemes and pass appropriate
method references from those objects to the `process()` method. While using
method references is likely more readable, lambda expressions could be used as
well. Consider the following code that performs the Caesar cipher with a key of
7, using a lambda expression instead of a method reference. Its output will be
identical to the version that passes in `caesarCipher::encrypt`.

[source, java]
----
String cipherText = process(plaintext, (letter, index) -> (char)((letter - 'A' + 7) % 26 + 'A'));
System.out.println("Ciphertext: " + cipherText);
----

Since they're more readable, use method references when available. Otherwise,
lambda expressions can be used for quick and dirty situations, especially when
the code will only be used a single time and doesn't warrant the creation of a
method to reference.

=== Concurrency: Lambda expressions and parallel streams

==== Threads with lambda expressions

<<concurrency#concurrency>> is where we'll finally introduce the Java syntax for
concurrency using threading, and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves.

That said, a key problem when creating a thread is specifying what code will
be executed. `Runnable` is a functional interface that contains the abstract
method `void run()`. Because it's a functional interface, you can create a
lambda expression that matches it. Below, the code will do just that, printing
out `"Threaded world!"` when executed.

[source, java]
----
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Threaded world!"));
thread.start();
----

If you're hungry for more details about how to use threads to solve problems,
head over to the next chapter.

==== Parallel streams

Just as you can use streams to process data sequentially with a single
core, you can also use them to process data in parallel with multiple cores. In
general, sequential streams can be converted into parallel ones and vice versa.

Consider the following code that creates a parallel stream instead of a
sequential one, by calling the `parallelStream()` method on a list instead of
the `stream()` method.

[source, java]
----
var words = Arrays.asList("paragraph", "understand", "stir", "exemption", "dance");
words
    .parallelStream()
    .forEach(word -> System.out.println(word));
----

Just like the sequential stream, this code will print out each word. However,
there's no guarantee *when* each thread will execute the code that prints out.
Thus, a parallel stream might print the words in an unpredictable order. On one
execution, the code above might have the following output.

....
stir
dance
exemption
understand
paragraph
....

On others, it could be different, even matching the sequential output.

A parallel stream can also process data beyond doing simple output. For example,
the following code finds the longest `String` in the stream, `"understand"` in
this case.

[source, java]
----
String longest = words
    .parallelStream()
    .reduce("", (word1, word2) -> {
        if (word1.length() >= word2.length()) {
            return word1;
        } else {
            return word2;
        }
    });
----

This code works provided that the operation being done in the `reduce()` call
is _associative_, meaning that it doesn't matter how the data is divided up 
before performing the operation. The operations will still be applied in order,
but the left half and the right half of the list of numbers might be processed
at the same time before the left result is combined with the right result.

This idea mirrors associative operations in math, which can arbitrarily add or
remove parentheses without affecting the results. For example, addition is
associative, as demonstrated by the equation
(5 + 3) + 7 = 15 = 5 + (3 + 7). However, subtraction is *not* associative, since
(5 - 3) - 7 = -5 ≠ 5 - (3 - 7) = 9.

Of course, comparing the lengths of two `String` values is not very
computationally intensive, so using parallel streams here is unlikely to be
faster than using sequential streams (or `for` loops). Nevertheless, there may
be some cases where the operations done on each element of data are
time-consuming enough that using a parallel stream will be faster. For that to
be true, the processor must have multiple cores, and the work that the Stream
API is doing behind the scenes to create threads and coordinate them must not
take up more time than the savings gained through parallel computation.

Consider the following code that finds the sum of the sines of the numbers from
0 up to (but not including) 1,000,000, using both parallel and sequential
streams.

[source, java]
----
double[] numbers = new double[1000000];
for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
    numbers[i] = i;
}

double parallelSum = DoubleStream.of(numbers)
    .parallel()
    .map(number -> Math.sin(number))
    .sum();

double sequentialSum = DoubleStream.of(numbers)
    .map(number -> Math.sin(number))
    .sum();

System.out.println("Parallel sum:   " + parallelSum);
System.out.println("Sequential sum: " + sequentialSum);
----

On our test system, the output is as follows.

....
Parallel sum:   0.23288397807311884
Sequential sum: 0.23288397807311667
....

There's a small difference between the results because the order in which the
numbers were added was different. Consequently, there can be differences in
floating-point rounding. These differences will depend on the number of threads
created by the system, which is automatically determined by the number of cores.

Depending on a number of different properties of a given system, the parallel
stream in this example might take more or less time than the sequential one.

We'll return to a similar problem in <<arraySummationExample>>, where we'll
handle the details of thread creation directly instead of using streams.
Although parallel streams are a useful, readable tool that can solve this
particular problem, they're not flexible enough to perform all parallel
processing tasks.

=== Exercises
*Conceptual Problems*

. [[functionalLanguagesExercise]] What are some features of functional languages
that make them different from typical object-oriented languages like Java?
. [[functionalInterfaceExercise]] How is a functional interface different from a
normal interface in Java?
. [[methodReferenceExercise]] What is a method reference, and what is the syntax
for a reference to a specific method on a particular object?
. [[methodReferenceLambdaExercise]] What's the difference between a method
reference and a lambda expression?
. [[whenUseLambdaExercise]] Under what circumstances should you use a lambda
expression instead of a method reference?

be done with streams can also be accomplished with loops?

*Programming Practice*

. Consider a functional interface called `StringComparator`.
[loweralpha]
.. [[makeFunctionalInterfaceExercise]] Write such an interface  with a
`compare()` method that takes two `String` values and returns an `int`.
.. [[vowelLambdaExercise]] Write a lambda expression compatible with this
interface that compares the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, and u) in the two
`String` values. If the first `String` has more vowels, return a positive
number. If the second `String` has more vowels, return a negative number. If
they have the same number of vowels, return 0.
. [[caseInsensitiveLambdaExercise]] Sorting `String` values is a common task, 
but calling the normal, one-parameter version of `Arrays.sort()` on an array of
`String` values will sort them in a case-sensitive way, putting all words that
start with an uppercase letter before any word that starts with a lowercase
letter. Pass a lambda expression to the second parameter of `Arrays.sort()` so
that it will sort an array of `String` values in a case-insensitive way. Hint:
You can use the `compareToIgnoreCase()` method on `String` objects.
+
Test your code on the following array.
+
[source, java]
----
String[] words = {"Split", "portion", "Echo", "Visit", "allowance", "distribute", "NAME", "freighter", "lean", "Facade"};
----
. [[caseInsensitiveMethodExercise]] Rewrite your solution to the previous
exercise to pass in only a single method reference, not a lambda expression.
. When trying to break a classical encryption, a common technique is a frequency
attack, which counts the occurrences of each letters in a ciphertext. Since some
letters in English are used commonly while others are rare, the count of each
letter can give insight into how the ciphertext was encrypted and how it can be
decrypted.
+
The `IntStream` class is used for streams of `char` values. In fact, there's a
`chars()` method on `String` objects that returns a stream of `int` values whose
numerical values are the same as the `char` values. First, create an array of
`int` values with length 26 to count the occurrences of each letter of the
alphabet. Then, use the `chars()` method on a `String` to process all its
`char` values in a stream, incrementing the location in the array that
corresponds to the letter of the alphabet (0 for A, 1 for B, and so on). Skip
values that aren't uppercase letters.
+
Finally, flesh out this code into a full program that reads in a `String` and
reports the fraction of the text corresponding to each letter. Although you must
use a stream to count the letter occurrences, you may use a loop to print out
the final letter frequencies.
. [[filterStreamExercise]] Write code that will convert a list of `Integer` values
into a stream, keep only the even numbers, and print out the remaining values.
Use no loops. For example, you might start with the following list.
+
[source, java]
----
var numbers = Arrays.asList(75, 38, 173, 176, 11, 188, 130, 94, 159, 52);
----
+
Then, the matching output would be below.
+
....
38
176
188
130
94
52
....
. [[mapStreamExercise]] Write code that generates a stream of values from 1 up to
(and including) 100, finds the square root of each number, and prints it out.
You can either use `IntStream` to generate these numbers and then convert the
stream to a `DoubleStream` or you can generate a `DoubleStream` directly. No 
loops should appear in the code.

*Experiments*

. [[timingLazyExercise]] Lazy evaluation is a powerful tool, but it doesn't
entirely remove the burden of optimizing performance. To understand the issues,
create an array of `int` values with length 100,000,000. Fill the array with
random values by repeatedly calling the `nextInt()` method on a `Random` object.
Now, create an `IntStream` from the array, filter it first to contain only `int`
values that are less than 10,000, then filter it to contain only odd numbers,
and finally use the `max()` method to find the largest value. Then, create a
second `IntStream` from the same array, filter it first to contain only odd
numbers, then filter it to contain only `int` values that are less than 10,000,
and again use the `max()` method to find the largest value. Since both streams
are finding the largest odd number less than 10,000 in the array, the results
should be the same. Now, insert timing code to see how long each stream took to
find the answer. Run the code several times to be sure the answer is consistent.
Which stream takes longer to run, and why?
. [[timingParallelStreamExercise]] In <<Parallel streams>>, we gave an example
using both sequential and parallel streams to find the sum of the sines of the
numbers from 0 up to (but not including) 1,000,000. Add timing code to this
example to determine how long the sequential and parallel versions take. Is the
parallel version faster than the sequential? If it is, divide the size of the
problem by 10 (100,000 values) to see if it's still faster. If the parallel
version isn't faster, multiply the size of the problem by 10 (10,000,000 values)
and time it again. Keep dividing or multiplying the size of the problem until
the sequential and parallel versions switch order in terms of running time.
. [[timingStreamAgainstLoopExercise]] Write a loop that performs the same
summation of the sines of numbers from 0 up (but not including) 1,000,000 and
time it. How does its running time compare to the sequential stream that
performs the same task?
