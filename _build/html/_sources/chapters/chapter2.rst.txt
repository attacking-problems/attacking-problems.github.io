Test of Regular Java Formatting
-------------------------------

Here is the inline-formatting test::

    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class Example {
    	public static void main(String[] args) {
    		Scanner in;
            in = new Scanner(System.in);
    		System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
    		int value;
    		value = in.nextInt();
    		System.out.print("That number doubled is: ");
            System.out.println(value * 2);
        }
    }
